# Docs - where to put what

The project template_ may also be used as a boiler template for writing
documentation in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), see
the [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdow) on Wikipedia on syntax
etc.

The _docs_ directory has the following structure adopted from
[TextBundle](textbundle.org):

  - **assets/CSS**: CSS for generating html and pdf files
  - **assets/img**: Images for your files
  - **media-source**: Image source if the image is created in e.g an OS X application

Compilation from markdown to other formats may be achieved using ``make`` - provided
the correct compilers are installed.
